# :sunglasses: Quote of the day

I started from here: [Azure SWAG](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps?WT.mc_id=build2020_swa-github-yolasors) (**S**tatic **W**eb **A**pps on **G**itHub).


It includes a website using HTML + JavaScript and a Node.js API.
See it live [here](https://gray-hill-0afb0d903.azurestaticapps.net).



## What's Azure *SWAG*?

TL;DR:

> It's an all-inclusive hosting service for web apps with serverless APIs built using JavaScript, based on continuous deployment from a *GitHub repository*.

For the longer version with the deployment instructions, [see this full length article](https://dev.to/sinedied/the-easy-way-to-serverless-web-apps-and-apis-with-azure-swag-2heb).

Take a look at [the official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps?WT.mc_id=build2020_swa-github-yolasors).
